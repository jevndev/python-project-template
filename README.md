# Python Project Template

This is a minimal project template of tools I like to use for developing python applications.

## Features:

1. Unified CLI for interfacing with project via `make`
2. Virtual Environment for dependency/environment management
3. Ruff support for linting
4. Pytest support for testing

## Make Commands

### `make setup`

Set up the virtual env for this project, install base dependencies

### `make run`

Run the package in `src/`

### `make test`

Run the tests in `tests/`

### `make clean`

Clear cached files

## Future features:
* Docker Support
* Auto update requirements on `requirements.txt` update
